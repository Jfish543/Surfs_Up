# Surfs_Up

Overview: The point of this exercise is to look at weather patterns in Hawaii as we try to open an ice cream shop. Our focus was on the temperature in June and December, looking at summary statistics to see if there would be good weather conditions to open the shop during those months.

Results: Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees, the maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also similar, the minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the December numbers.

Summary: The weather in December and June are similar, however December has more variance with its low temperature being much lower than Juneâ€™s and the high being close to Junes.

Additional weather queries that could be run could be rain patterns between June and December and humidity during these time periods. If it rains a ton and maybe even snows during December it may be a bad time to open the store and if it is humid during the summer, it may be a better time to open the store.
